        "subtitle": "The Fox and the Crow Early one morning, a fox is walking through the woods. He is hungry, and he is looking for something to eat. He sees a crow sitting on the highest branch of a tree. The crow has a piece of cheese in her beak. Mmm… I love cheese! thinks the fox. I think I’ve found my breakfast! But how can I get the cheese? He thinks and he thinks. Then he has a clever idea. I will make her talk! He sits at the bottom of the tree and looks up at the crow. Good morning, Miss Crow! he says. It’s a lovely day, isn’t it? The crow looks down at the fox. She says nothing. I said, good morning! says the fox. Did you hear me? Maybe you can't hear me up there... The crow is suspicious. She holds the cheese tightly in her beak and says nothing. Hmm. This is not so easy, thinks the fox. But he doesn’t give up. He smiles at the crow. You know… you really are the most beautiful bird, he says. Your feathers are so shiny! Your eyes are so intelligent! Your beak is so…umm… pointy! Everything about you is perfect! Still, the crow says nothing. So he fox says: Tell me, Miss Crow…is your voice ALSO magnificent? I hear that you have the most wonderful voice. Please sing for me! Just one song! Then I can tell everyone you really are the most incredible bird — the queen of all birds, in fact! This makes the crow feel good. She wants everyone to know she has a wonderful voice. She wants everyone to know that she is the queen of all birds. She smiles a little smile. Then she smiles a big smile. Then she opens her mouth to sing her best song for the fox. And… plop! The cheese drops out of her beak and falls straight into the mouth of the fox. He swallows it in one gulp. MMmmmmm! Thank you for the delicious breakfast, Miss Crow! laughs the fox as he walks away. Have a lovely day! Moral: Beware of flatterers. They often want something from you."

        "subtitle": "The Oak Tree One hot day, two hikers are walking in the dry, brown hills. They have been walking all day, and they are tired and hungry. They see a tree in the distance. I am sooooo hungry! says one hiker. Do you think that’s an apple tree? I want a big, crunchy, red apple! Nah, that’s not an apple tree, says the other. It's a pear tree! Pears are my favorite. I want a sweet, juicy, yellow pear! But when they arrive at the tree, there are no apples. Or pears either! In fact, there is no fruit at all. Aw, boo! says one hiker. It’s a useless oak tree! Just then, the sky turns grey and it starts to rain. The two hikers run under the oak tree to stay dry. It rains and rains, but the oak tree is like a big umbrella. The hikers don't get wet. They wait under the oak tree for the rain to stop. Day turns into night. I’m cold, says one hiker. We should make a fire. Help me collect some wood! Luckily, there are many old branches under the oak tree. The two hikers collect the branches and make a nice campfire out of them. They sit beside the fire to warm themselves. I’m tired, says one hiker. We should sleep here tonight. Help me make a bed! The hikers make a bed out of soft, green oak leaves. They snuggle into the leaves and fall asleep. The rain falls and the wind blows, but the hikers are comfortable, warm and dry — under the useless oak tree. Moral: Sometimes the best gifts aren’t what we originally hoped for."

        "subtitle": "The Dog and his Bone A dog is walking down the street, when he sees a bone in a trash can. A bone! Yippee! How lucky for me! he thinks. He grabs the bone, and happily runs home. He runs past the train station and the school. He runs through the park. He runs onto a bridge. On the bridge, the dog looks down into the deep, still water below. There, he sees another dog with a bone in its mouth. Who is that dog? he wonders. What is he doing down there? The dog stares at the other dog. The other dog stares back. Where did that dog get such a BIG bone? the dog wonders. Why is his bone bigger than mine? The dog growls at the other dog. The other dog growls too. I want that big bone! he thinks. The greedy dog decides to steal the other dog's bone. He leaps off the bridge and into the water. Splash! But as soon as he hits the water, the other dog disappears. There was never any other dog. It was just his own reflection! The water is very deep and the dog is surprised. Woof woof woof! Help! he barks. And when he barks, his bone drops from his mouth — and sinks to the bottom of the water. The dog swims to shore. He is wet and cold, and now he has no bone at all. Moral: Be happy with what you have. If you're greedy, you might lose everything."

        "subtitle": "The Wind and the Sun The wind and the sun are having a disagreement. I am the most powerful! says the wind. No, I am the most powerful! says the sun. I can blow trees to the ground! brags the wind. I can push ships across the ocean. I can make hurricanes and tornadoes! Is that right? replies the sun. Well, I can melt all the snow on the mountains. I can dry up an entire lake. I can make a sidewalk so hot that it cooks an egg! Just then, they see a man walking along the road in his winter jacket. Let’s have a contest to see who is more powerful, says the wind. Whoever can remove the man’s jacket first wins. The sun agrees. The wind goes first. He blows a gust of cold wind at the man. The man shivers and zips up his jacket. Brrr! What a cold and windy day! It starts to rain. The wind blows even harder and turns the rain into snow. Well look at that! It’s snowing! says the man. Snow wasn’t in the weather forecast today... He pulls his hood over his head. The wind blows his strongest gust towards the man, but the man’s jacket stays on. Hmm. It’s a bit fresh today… he says. A winter storm must be coming... He zips the jacket higher to cover his nose. Gah! This is impossible, says the wind. He stops blowing. My turn! says the sun. First the sun shines enough to stop the snow. The man unzips his hood. Then the sun pulls the clouds apart and gently shines down on the man. Suddenly, it is a beautiful spring day. Wow. The weather sure is strange around here! says the man. He unzips his jacket. The sun gently wiggles her fingers and increases the temperature. What strange weather. Now it feels like summer! the man says as he begins to sweat. Goodness me, it's so hot! He removes his winter jacket. He lies down on the grass for a nap in the warm sun. I win! says the sun, beaming. Moral: Sometimes warmth and gentleness can achieve more than strength and force."

        "subtitle": "The Girl and the Ice Cream Truck An original tale by TheFableCottage.com A girl sits at her bedroom window, looking down at the street. She is waiting for summer. She wants to eat ice cream and go swimming. She wants picnics and strawberries. She is tired of winter jackets and gloves. She is tired of grey skies and snow. Her mother says that summer is far away. Her father says that more snow is coming. Still, she sits at the window waiting for some sign that summer has arrived. Just then, she sees an ice cream truck driving down the street. An ice cream truck! That MUST mean it’s summer now! she squeals. She runs to her closet and puts on her bathing suit and her summer hat. She runs down the stairs and out the door and… CRUNCH! She looks down and sees her bare feet... ….in the icy grass. But…but… I saw an ice cream truck! she says, confused. She looks up just in time to see the ice cream truck turn the corner ... ... and pull into the auto repair shop. Moral: Don’t draw a conclusion based on a single observation; one ice cream truck does not make a summer!"

        "subtitle": "Do not Trust anybody. Once a merchant was going through the forest with his camel. He left the camel in the forest, as it was sick and continued his journey all by himself. It ate whatever was available in the forest, recovered soon, and was happy. The Lion, Fox, and the Crow were living in unity in the same forest. They came to know about the camel and they inquired about it. The camel narrated the incident, and all four became good friends. One day, when the lion hunted an Elephant, it got hurt very badly. So, he stayed inside his den and could not come out. The Lion could not go out hunting. The other animals could not hunt, and all of them starved. The Lion called the Fox, the Crow, and the Camel. 'Mr. Fox, I am very hungry,' he said. 'Go in this direction and get me some food. Mr. Crow, you go in the other direction. Mr. Camel, you go in the opposite direction and get something. All three of you must come back with food. Okay, you can go now.' All three went in different directions but could not get any food. They met again together and took a decision. Accordingly, they stood in front of the Lion. The Lion said, 'I searched everywhere but could not get food to satisfy your hunger. So, I offer myself as food, and you can eat me.' 'No, My Lord,' said the Crow, 'I am too small. I will not be able to satisfy your hunger. You can kill and eat me.' 'No, Your Honor,' said the Fox, 'I am the last of the three, and I am the only one who can satisfy not only your hunger but the others' hunger as well. So, you kill and eat me.' Though each one gave their own ideas, as soon as the Camel gave his idea, the Lion and the Fox pounced on him immediately. Moral: Those who are cunning will always fulfill their wicked thoughts, however friendly you may be. If you trust others easily, you will naturally have to face unexpected difficulties. Even if it appears good at the first instance, when the time comes, the wicked person's nature will not change.

        "subtitle": "The Frightened Lion (A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com) One night, Lion is getting ready for bed. He reads his favorite bedtime story and sings his favorite bedtime song. He turns on his night-light. Then — he hears a sound... Tap! … Tap! 'What’s that sound?' he whispers. Tap! … Tap! 'That sound… it’s coming from outside the window!' He climbs out of bed. He grabs a baseball bat and tip-toes towards the window. Tap! Tap! Tappity-tap! TAP! 'It’s a monster!' he thinks. He grabs his bicycle helmet and puts it on his head for protection. He hears the sound again... TAP! ... TAP! … Tappity-TAP! Lion panics. 'The monster is getting closer! It sounds like the BIGGEST, SCARIEST monster ever!' Tap! ... Tap! ... Tappity-tap! TAPPITY-TAP! TAPPITY-TAPPITY-TAPPITY…. TAP! 'EEEK!' Lion squeals. He runs away from the window and hides under the bed. He pulls a blanket over his head. He holds his baseball bat tightly in his hands, and… Tappity tap! ... A little frog jumps up on the window sill. The frog is wearing a tutu and tap shoes. She dances a little dance. Tap tap tappity tap! 'Hello Lion! Are you in there?' says the frog. She looks through the window and sees Lion hiding under the bed. Lion is wrapped in a blanket… wearing a bicycle helmet… and holding a baseball bat. He looks ridiculous. (And to be honest, he feels ridiculous too.) 'Ummm… I have some new dance moves to show you,' says the frog. 'But you look busy. I will come back later. See ya!' The frog hops down to the ground and happily dances away. Tap-TAP! Tappity-tappity-TAP! Moral: Sometimes our imaginations make things scarier than they really are."

        "subtitle": "The Fox and the Stork Retold and illustrated by Gerald McDermott. Long ago, there was a fox who lived in the forest. Fox liked to play tricks on his friends. One morning, Fox rowed his boat around the pond. He saw his friend Stork and said, 'Would you like to come to my house for dinner?' Fox asked. 'How kind of you to ask!' said Stork. 'Yes. I would like that.' The next day, Stork went to Fox’s house for dinner. She tapped on Fox’s door with her long bill. 'Come in,' said Fox. 'I made soup!' 'Wonderful!' said Stork. 'I like soup.' Fox and Stork sat down to eat. Fox didn’t put the soup in a bowl. He served it in a flat dish. Fox felt very smart. Stork couldn’t eat from the flat dish. All she could do was dip the tip of her long bill into the soup. Fox soon slurped it all up! Stork was still hungry, but she didn’t complain. 'Thank you for the dinner,' said Stork. 'Come to my house, and I’ll make dinner for you.' The next day, Fox rode his boat to Stork's house. 'I don't like to boast,' said Stork, 'but my soup is the best! I use greens that grow in my own garden.' 'Wonderful!' said Fox, 'Let's eat!' Stork served the soup in a tall jar. Fox couldn't get a drop! All he could do was lick the top of the jar. Stork dipped in her long bill and drank it all up. Fox moaned and groaned as he rowed home. 'I'm so hungry! This is my reward for tricking a friend!' At last, Fox saw that being kind to others is the right thing to do!"
